1. Would you use a unit test to test the “message” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “message” feature allows a user to write and send a message to another user.
    - You would use a unit test to test the "message" feature of a messaging application, as the primary function of the messaging application is to message. Therefore, writing a unit test that verifies the message being sent correctly without any bugs or errors would be crucial for the success of the application.
      
2. Would you use a unit test to test the “max message length” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “max message length” feature prevents the user from typing more than 80 characters.
    - You would use a unit test to test the "max message length" feature of a messaging application, as you need to check if the limit is properly working. If it does not properly work, it could cause errors in other parts of the application. Since unit tests can help test this functionality in isolation, it would be important to write a unit test for testing the "max message length" feature for a messaging application.
